# Neovim for Data Science

This repo has my configuration files for setting up neovim for data science. 
I mainly use Julia and R, so there are many goodies associated with these two languages.
Neovim has largely replaced all of my editors, so I no longer need Rstudio or VSCode.
I hope anyone finding this repo has some use for the config files.

As always, feel free to email me at iu.ricardo@maastrichtuniversity.nl if you have any questions.
